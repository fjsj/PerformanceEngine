From [official documentation] (http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/localunittesting.html):

While running testrunner.py, provide the path to your App Engine SDK installation and the path to your test modules.

Example:     
    
    python testrunner.py 'C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine' test

The script runs the tests and prints results to the standard error stream.
